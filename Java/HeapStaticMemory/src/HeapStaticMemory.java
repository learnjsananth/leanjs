		//Stack memory - all the methods and local variables are stored 
		//in stack memory - whenever method is called memory is 
		//created and its deleted after its returned .. heap memory - 
		//contains objects and instance variables ..
		//Memory is created whnever object is created and 
		//destroyed when the object referece becomes null..
		//and all the static variables reside in 
		//seperate memory space - meta space
