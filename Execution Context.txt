var a=2;
Function sum(num){
var ans=num*num
return ans;
}

var square1=sum(2);
var square2=sum(3);

first global execution context is created .call stack is a cotainer in which global execution is pushed in that you will have the variable component and execution component

variable component :
A undefined
sum {} function
square 1 : undefined
square 2 : undefined

Execuiton component

A will be assigned 2 
sum(2) - new execution context is created . Wheever a function is called , new global execution is created and pushed inside call stack

variable component:
num : undefined
ans : undefined

Execution component
num : 2
ans = 2*2
Once ans is returned , this execution context is deleted 
and it goes to global execution context

now sum(3) - new execution context is created - same process is followed and once ans is returned , this execution context is deleted and the control moves to global exeuction context ad GEC is deleted
