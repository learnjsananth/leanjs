//undefined vs Not defined

//Even before code is executed , global execution is context is created

//and memory  is allocated

var a = 7
//even before code is executed , a is given memory space
// a is undefined
//once cpde is executed , a = 7

console.log(x) //not defined - we have not initialized

var b ;

if(b==undefined){
  console.log("undefined")
}else{
  console.log("not undefined")
}

//Javascript is loosely coupled
// if a is 7 , later it can be string be number or boolean

// if its strict type , it cannot change to number or boolean

//a=undefined // dont do this .undefined is a place holder
//console.log(a)  undeined
